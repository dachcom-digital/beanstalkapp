# Beanstalk API Wrapper

## Test SetUp

To run the library's test suite, you need to configure it by copying the file `Tests/config.php.dist` to
`Tests/config.php` and supply your repository configuration. You need to create a test repository and configure its
properties in `Tests/config.php` in order to be able to run the test suite successfully.
